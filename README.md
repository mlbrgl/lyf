Lyf recognises our propensity to be attracted by the shinny and mysterious content behind links and helps us focus by hiding that temptation altogether.

## Focused reading on the web is hard

There are countless distractions calling for our attention. Ads, popups and notifications are among the most prominent ones, but there are also more subtle and pervasive ones: links.

Links are first class citizens on the web. One could even argue that they *are* the web. However, when it comes to reading, there are a massive hindrance. They force the reader to make a micro-decision not to click on every link in that important article, resist the sirens of serendipity and contend with the fear of missing out. That's a lot of extra work.

## It is more than ok to miss out: it is inevitable

Ridding the wave of the popular adage "Ignorance is bliss", Lyf turns pages into dead-ends (or *leaves* in tree structure terminology) by blending links back into the page's text. Links don't stand out anymore, and you can enjoy a more peaceful, intense and focused reading.
